  <h1>The World of Code</h1>
  <h2> A New Beginning </h2>
<p>Hello there! This is the World of Code, and when you learn how to use it, you'll be a master! <br>
  So, shall we get started? But some essentials: go to the website called Github. Make an account! <br>
  Learn HTML! I'll show you how, and give you some good websites. <br>
  Ok, so do you notice this font? This'll change soon. Pay attention. Now, we can start. <br>
  Or whatever, I'll just place a pig below me. </p>

  <h2>Why a Website?</h2>
  <p>But why would you make a website? Well, there's a list of reasons. Here! <br></p>
  <li>
    <ul>A website is one of the fastest and best ways of communicating, allowing you to express anything in a second.</ul>
    <ul>Github is free, therefore a website can be free to make.</ul>
    <ul>A website is not hard to make! It's easy to code, but even easier to use a maker, such as Wix and Weebly.</ul>
    <ul>It can easily be organized into anything between a clean sheet and a beautiful gallery. Which is a lot.</ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <h2>Hosting a Website</h2>
  <p>Have you made your account? If not, I've got you covered!<br>
    Go to <a href = "https://github.com/">the hosting service Github. Sign up!
    </a><br>I've made a tutorial, right <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2jk-LUQXEVrVElVRnhQMUJXREE/view">here.</a> However, that tutorial is <br>
  very clunky and bad, so I recommend using the official guide. I'll help you through it.<br>
  <a href = "https://pages.github.com/">(official guide)</a> So, once you're there, click "Project Site" and then "Start from scratch". <br>
  So, you can go on your own from there.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>The Basics of HTML</h2>
  <p>Every chunk of code is surrounded like this: <br>
  (line 1)  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; | So that's how you code! Surround everything in the less than and greater than signs. <br>
  Alright. That just makes it easy, because it's hard to type those in. But make sure that the closing tag (/p) has a slash right there. <br>
  Have you made your repositry? Yes? Then let's type in it! Look around, you'll find a pencil. Click it, and type in &lt;DOCTYPE HTML&gt;. <br>
  That lets the browser know this is a website made out of HTML. Now type in &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;(insert name of website)&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;. The head tag is where you put things that won't actually show on the website.<br>
  The title tag is what'll show up when someone bookmarks your website or has a tab open. (Notice how it says "Editing (name)/index.html")<br>
  Now do the same thing below the /head line. Type &lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;. The p tag stands for paragraph. It's the basic text block!</p>
