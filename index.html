  <h2> A New Beginning </h2>
<p>Hello there! This is the World of Code, and when you learn how to use it, you'll be a master! <br>
  So, shall we get started? But some essentials: go to the website called Github. Make an account! <br>
  Learn HTML! I'll show you how, and give you some good websites. <br>
  Ok, so do you notice this font? This'll change soon. Pay attention. Now, we can start. <br>
  Or whatever, I'll just place jelly below me. (?...) </p>

  <br>
  <h2>Why a Website?</h2> 
  <p>But why would you make a website? Well, there's a list of reasons. Here! <br></p>
  <ul>
    <li>A website is one of the fastest and best ways of communicating, allowing you to express anything in a second.</li>
    <li>Github is free, therefore a website can be free to make.</li>
    <li>A website is not hard to make! It's <strong>very easy</strong> to code, but even easier to use a maker, such as Wix and Weebly.</li>
    <li>It can easily be organized into anything between a clean sheet and a beautiful gallery. Which is a lot.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>Hosting a Website</h2>
  <p>Have you made your account? If not, I've got you covered!<br>
    Go to <a href = "https://github.com/">the hosting service Github. Sign up!
    </a><br>I've made a tutorial, right <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2jk-LUQXEVrVElVRnhQMUJXREE/view">here.</a> However, that tutorial is <br>
  very clunky and bad, so I recommend using the official guide. I'll help you through it.<br>
  <a href = "https://pages.github.com/">(official guide)</a> So, once you're there, click "Project Site" and then "Start from scratch". <br>
  So, you can go on your own from there. Once you make the repositry, don't go to the link- it leads to nothing. Instead, go to your repositry, and go to Settings. (on the toolbar)<br>
  There, scroll down to the GitHub Pages area. Picked Master Branch? Good! Now go to the link above it! That's your website. Once you click the commit button, reload the page.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>The Basics of HTML</h2>
  <p>Every chunk of code is surrounded like this: <br>
  (line 1)  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; | So that's how you code! Surround everything in the less than and greater than signs. <br>
  Alright. That just makes it easy, because it's hard for me to type those in. I need to type in 4 characters! <br>
    But make sure that the closing tag (/p) has a slash right there. <br>
  Have you made your repositry? Yes? Then let's type in it! Look around, you'll find a pencil. Click it, and type in &lt;DOCTYPE HTML&gt;. <br>
  That lets the browser know this is a website made out of HTML. Now type in &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;(insert name of website)&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;. The head tag is where you put things that won't actually show on the website.<br>
  The title tag is what'll show up when someone bookmarks your website or has a tab open. (Notice how it says "Editing (name)/index.html")<br>
  Now do the same thing below the /head line. Type &lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;. The p tag stands for paragraph. It's the basic text block! <br>
  That's all the basic stuff. Get ready to get advanced!</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Normal HTML...</h2>
  <p>It... it gets more advanced! (brace for tables) <br>
  Anyways, the first thing we go to? Line breaks. At the end of a sentence in the p tag, type in &lt;br&gt;.<br>
  You might notice there's no &lt;/br&gt;. Well, a line break doesn't need an ending. That doesn't make sense.<br>
  Now save and reload your website. Bam! They're seperated! So now you're wondering how I made that pig? <br>
  The magic of the IMG tag! Do you want an image? Well, it needs to be hosted rather than a file. There are some good hosting services out there, <br>
  but if you want an image from the internet, make sure the copyright's 3.0, I believe. <br>
    So, type in &lt;img scr="(link here)"&gt; without a &lt;/img&gt; tag. As for "link here", grab the image source. I have a tutorial how right <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2jk-LUQXEVrWld0UTlkM0xLR0U/view">here.</a><br>
    Now here is a bad place to place a disclaimer, but do I care? - As for my teacher, it took 10 years to memorize the table code. - Move on.
    <br>Now, to <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic</em> text, use the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag to bold and the &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tag to italic.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Advanced HTML</h2>
  <p>First of all: entities. There are advanced clusters of text that make things, such as the &lt; and &gt; symbols.<br>
    To get these, type in "&l t;" for the &lt; sign and "&g t;" for the &gt; sign. Remove the space.<br>
    &lt;insert annoying table&gt;</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Website Check!</strong><br>
  How're you doing on your website?<br>
  A great way- my way- to check websites is by inserting the code into the Khan Academy website scanner!<br>
    It's actually a website maker, but what do I care. So, go to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/webpage"></a>.<br>
  Type in your code by copy + pasting it in. Mess around until it looks good. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Basics of CSS</h2>
  <p>CSS, the best part of websites. This code will include coloring, image placement, id tags, fonts, all that. Yay! <br>
  By the way, </p>
