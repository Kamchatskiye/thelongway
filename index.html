  <h1>The World of Code</h1>
  <h2> A New Beginning </h2>
<p>Hello there! This is the World of Code, and when you learn how to use it, you'll be a master! <br>
  So, shall we get started? But some esentials: go to the website called Github. Make an account! <br>
  Learn HTML! I'll show you how, and give you some good websites. <br>
  Ok, so do you notice this font? This'll change soon. Pay attention. Now, we can start. <br>
  Or whatever, I'll just place a pig below me. </p>

  <h2>Hosting a Website</h2>
  <p>Have you made your account? If not, I've got you covered!<br>
    Go to <a href = "https://github.com/">the hosting service Github. Sign up!
    </a><br>I've made a tutorial, right <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2jk-LUQXEVrVElVRnhQMUJXREE/view">here.</a> However, that tutorial is <br>
  very clunky and bad, so I recommend using the official guide. I'll help you through it.<br>
  <a href = "https://pages.github.com/">(official guide)</a> So, once you're there, click "Project Site" and then "Start from scratch". <br>
  So, you can go on your own from there.</p>
